Being self-taught, I believe in life-long learning and knowledge sharing.

I also deeply believe in the open-source movement and try to give back to the community whenever I can.

I am part of the ‘90s generation that grew up with the Fresh Prince of Bel Air and the Commodore 64.

Understanding how stuff works is a passion that I showed since the age of 5,
in fact I tried to assemble and disassemble both Commodore and Amiga with very positive results,
but with a lot of anger as well.

It was caused by the fact that the more parts I discovered, the more I could not understand how they worked.

When I grew up, lots of things became clearer and the field of computer science became my main passion.

I started to get closer to the art of programming relatively late, around 16 years old, before,
I dabbled only in programming micro C software on consoles, nothing important.

The hard programming began exactly when I was 16. After that,
I took a diploma in computer science in Italy then I started to study computer engineering in Switzerland at SUPSI
where I learnt a lot of basic essential techniques for a good engineer.

I'm deeply proud of my work and I strongly believe in continuous formation because technology never stops and I will not ever let it go too far from my passion.
